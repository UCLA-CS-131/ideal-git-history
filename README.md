# A (Good) Git History

In general, a good git history is one that shows evidence of incremental development.  

For example, in this repo we can easily tell:
- the order in which features were added
- what bugs were fixed along the way
- if any significant refactoring was done 

A good rule of thumb for a solid commit history addresses each of these points directly: **you should commit when you add a new feature, fix a bug, or perform any significant refactoring.**

You should also make sure your commit messages are **descriptive**. If you can't read your message and understand exactly what was changed, the message isn't descriptive enough.

Here's a descriptive message: `implement auto vertical scrolling`

Here's a vague message (which you should avoid): `bug fix`

To be clear, this is an example of a good git history for the purposes of this class. It's probably not ideal for a more formal environment. **All we care about here is evidence of incremental development!** It's not important how many commits you have, as long as they provide that evidence.
